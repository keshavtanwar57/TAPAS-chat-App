    "Databases allow the modern infrastructure for the internet that enables the complex and vast functionality of all applications that we depend on for our daily usage. Databases allow us to store information related to any processes or pipelines where there is a requirement to store it for future use. Databases also enable to establish logical connections between the data that is stored in it and also helpful in establishing relationships between all the datapoints such as separate tables or relation between two tables or more. These databasesrequire some form of interaction from the user in order to perform some action. These actions are often called as transactions. For performing these transactions, the general methodology is to ask a query to the database and the database management software returns the answer to the user. This process involves a programming language by which, the queries are made. The most common example for such language is Structured Query languages (SQL). MySQL is one of the most popular SQL languages that is currently in use.";
String AboutBody2 =
    "SQL is an easy language to learn for those who understand programming languages or have hands on knowledge on how programming languages work. As mentioned earlier, SQL involves writing queries for performing transactions on the database, that can be a simple query to read a particular row or the whole table or some complex queries that require joins and nested SQL queries in a single query. For a particular individual who is a beginner or intermediate at SQL language or in just how databases work, this might lead to decrease the productivity of the individual. Also speaking of someone who is not that particularly good with SQL queries, it might be a hard task to perform the transaction and this overall gives the disadvantage of wastage of time and energy";

String AboutBody3 =
    "Our project aims to solve the above-mentioned problem with the usage of Natural Language Processing in such a way that natural English language can be used to generate SQL Queries and complete these transactions, which results in increase of productivity and reducing the overall complexity of the SQL language in perspective of a SQL user or someone with little to no knowledge of how databases work. With just a basic English sentence, user will be able to do tasks instead of figuring out a complex SQL statement thus boosting the efficiency of the teams who work on bigger projects.";
